            <br> Hey there, welcome to my recently REVISED and AMPLIFIED web development portfolio! You may have seen this portfolio circulating the internet, most likely as a meme or gif, showcasing what NOT to do. Recently cancelled but suddenly self-aware, I invite you to parody, critique and analyse the shit out of this portfolio so that I can finally let go of an embarrasing but cute period of my life. The story of why I attended General Assembly's coding bootcamp to 'find my passion and purpose' is complicated. I didn't my find my passion OR my purpose, and it's a much longer, and deeper story than you think it is. <br>
            
            But what I DID find, was a sense of belonging. It was lovely being invited into General Assembly's wonderful community of diverse thinkers, dreamers and doers. Who genuinely want to see you succeed, flourish and grow. This portfolio, which you are unfortunately viewing, has been tragically neglected; littered with br and bad code. Yes, it looks like a bit of a joke, but it was an important milestone and a piece of comedic history that I'd like to keep live. Laugh all you want, but I'm emotionally attached to this piece of trash. 

              <br><br>
            And as cheesy as this sounds, a class reunion is definitely in order.

            <br>
            I'm proud of PwnLists. In addition to its legendary name, unique blue and white UI theme (thanks default bootstrap), and intricate db design, it had surprisingly strong user engagement. My classmates enthusiastically created their own lists, laughed at each other and created some more. Or maybe they were just entertaining me but I loved it. At it's core, it encouraged those who may be a little shy in class to bond over these silly gaming lists. It was nostalgic too - a beautiful moment I wish I had captured in a photo or video.

            A game collection web app where users can sign up for an account and create their own video game lists. PwnLists encourages users to be creative with their lists and tests gamers on how much they know about the game they love.
