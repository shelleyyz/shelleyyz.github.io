          <p>

            <br>
            <br> I am a coding bootcamp graduate from Sydney.

            <br>
            <br> I have always been tech savvy and have had a pretty successful start to my career as an IT Business Analyst. I have worked worked with many different tech stakeholders using agile methodologies to deliver projects.

            <br>
            <br> Recently I started to gravitate towards working more closely with dev teams to gain deeper understanding of software engineering. I have almost completed the GA Web Development course gaining the technical skills needed to solve complex
            problems - not through requirements but code.

            <br>
            <br> When I'm not coding, you will most likely find me 'pwning' noobs in competitive online video games or enjoying the storyline of an epic RPG or action-adventure game. I also enjoy long hikes with my dog Spyro and chilling at home with
            my cat Luna.

            <br>
            <br>

            The first game I've ever programmed. It's a simple two player game of TicTacToe built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. The basic requirement is to have the game switch turns between X and O and visually display which gets three in a row or a draw
            is found. In addition the basics, I've added simple animations and styling.<br><br> View the source code <a href="https://github.com/shelleyyz/tic-tac-toe">here</a>.
