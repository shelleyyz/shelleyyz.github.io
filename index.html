  <h2>About</h2>

    <p id="intro text">

      Hi, I'm Shelley Zhang. I'm a coding bootcamp graduate from Sydney.

      I have always been tech savvy and have had a pretty successful start to my career as an IT Business Analyst. I have worked worked with many different tech stakeholders using agile methodologies to deliver projects.

      Recently I started to gravitate towards working more closely with dev teams to gain deeper understanding of software engineering. I have almost completed the GA Web Development course gaining the technical skills needed to solve complex problems - not through requirements but code.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<a href="https://shelleyyz.github.io/tic-tac-toe/">Tic Tac Toe</a>

  <p>
    The first game I've ever programmed. It's a simple two player game of TicTacToe built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. The basic requirement is to have the game switch turns between X and O and visually display which gets three in a row or a draw is found. In addition the basics, I've added simple animations and styling. View the source code <a href="https://github.com/shelleyyz/tic-tac-toe">here</a>.

<a href="https://pwnlist.herokuapp.com/">PwnLists</a>

  <p>
    A game collection web application where users can sign up for an account and create their own video game lists. PwnLists encourages users to be creative with their lists and really tests gamers on how much they know about the game they know and love. There's plenty of game collection list creators out there but I wanted to create one based on the Steam Awards poll that's held every year.
